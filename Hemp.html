 <h1>HEMP TREE</h1>
 <h2>About Hemp Tree</h2>
<p>Cannbis sativa flowers are unisexual and the plants are often male or female.It is a short-lived flowering plant,static(male) plants usually taller and less strong than pistillate(female or male) plants.The flowers of the female plant are arranged in recemes and can procuce hundredes of seeds.Male plants shed pollen and die few weeks before female plant's seeds ripen.Under normal conditons with a light duration of 12 to 14 hours, the hereditary X and Y chromosomes produce both sexes in equal numbers.Although a plant becomes male or female by genetic factors,environmental factors, including the daily light cycle can alter sexsual expression.Naturally occuring single plant,both male or female parts infertile or fertile; but artificially induced "hermaphrodites" may have fully functional reproductive organs.The "female" seeds sold by most commercial seed suppliers are derived from synthetic "hermaphoroditic" female animals or plants treated with hormones or silver thiosulfate without the male genes.</p>
<p>Although the main psychoactive constituent of Cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant is known to contain more than 500 compounds, among them at least 113 cannabinoids; however, most of these "minor" cannabinoids are only produced in trace amounts.Besides THC, another cannabinoid produced in high concentrations by some plants is cannabidiol (CBD), which is not psychoactive but has recently been shown to block the effect of THC in the nervous system.Differences in the chemical composition of Cannabis varieties may produce different effects in humans. Synthetic THC, called dronabinol, does not contain cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), or other cannabinoids, which is one reason why its pharmacological effects may differ significantly from those of natural Cannabis preparations.</p>
<p>The main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol(THC),the plantis known to contain more than 500 compounds,including at least 113 cannabinoids;However  most of these "minor" cannabinoids are produced in small quantities.In addition to THC there is another cannabinoid cannabidiol(CBD) produced by some plants in high concentrations,which has not been psychoactive but has recently been shown to block the effects of THC in the nervous system.Changes in the chemical composition of cannabis varieties can have different effects on humans.Dronabinol,also known as synthetic THC,does not contain cannabidiol(CBD),cannabionol(CBN) or other cannabinoids, and is one of the reason why its pharamacological effects are significantly different from natural cannabis preparation. </p>
<p>In addition to cannabinoids,cannabis chemical compounds contain about 120 compounds that are resposible for its characteristic odor.These are mainly volatile tepenes and sesquiterpenses.α-Pinene,Myrcene,Linoleum,Limonine,Trans-β-ocimene,α-Turpinoline,Trans-karyophylline,Humulene,The characteristic odor of cannabis sativa contributes.Some hashish detective dogs are trained with karyphylline.Prenylthiol(3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol)which has been identified as the main odor,produce a number of volatile sulfur compounds that contribute to the cannabis plant's skull-like odor.Thses compounds are found in much lower concentrations than the major terpenes and sesquiterpenes.However,they significantly contribute to the pungent odor of cannabis due to the low odor limits often found with thiol or other sulfer- containing compounds.</p>  
<p>A cannabis plant in its vegetative growth stage needs more than 16-18 hours of light per day to remain vegetative.Flowering ususally occurs when darkness is at least 12 hours a day.The< flowering cycle can last anywhere between seven and fifteen weeks depending on the weather and environmental conditions.Insearch of psychoactive cannabinoid production,female plants are grown seperately from male plants to form parthenocarp in the fruit of the female plant(without seeds in spanish as "sin simila") and increases the production of cannabinoid-rich gum.In the soil,the optimum pHfor the plant is 6.3 to 6.8.During hydroponic growth,the nutrient solution is best between 5.2 and 5.8,this pH range is well suited for cannabis hydropoincs as it is hostile to most bacteria and fungi.Tissue culture multiplication has become important in the production of clinically important clones,and seed production is generally the prefferred medium for multiplication.Sativa plants have narrow leaves and grow well in warm climates.However they take longer to flower than their Indica counterparts,and they grow taller than the Indica cannabis varieties.</p>

<h4>Potential Health Benefits of Hemp Seeds</h4>

<p>Hemp seeds are an excellent source of plant-based protein. They contain all nine essential amino acids, and research suggests that hemp’s protein content is well-absorbed by our bodies.</p>

<p>In addition to this protein load, hemp seeds history is tied to their potential health benefits. Many modern studies have backed up several of these claims.</p>

<p>They used to eat.The flakes of the bones are seperated and eaten as a cereal.Hemp seeds are blended to make milk.The milk of hemp seed is named as "Hemp Milk".
And also the cannabis seed is used to make cofee and cookies. Hemp seeds can hold oil. Hemp oil is full of Omega 369 fatty acid. Hemp oil is also used for salads and making foods.
Alcohol can be extracted from the starch in hemp seeds. In the countries like Canada and USA, hemp spirit is used to make beer and vine(40%).
And also cannabis is used to make chocolates and fruit juice.</p>

<p>Natural and organic fibers become more and more popular these years. Most of the people come to realize that nature, soft and healthy are the most important things of the textile. Hemp fiber is naturally one of the most environmentally friendly fibers and also the oldest. The Columbia history of the world states that the oldest relics of human industry are bits of Hemp fabric discovered in tombs dating back to approximately 8000 B.C.</p>

<p>Hemp is called as a fiber of hundred uses. It was important for textile production. Besides fabrics, Hemp is also used in the production of paper. The oldest piece of paper – over 2000 yrs old was discovered in China and is made from Hemp.
Until 1883, between 75% and 90% of all paper in the world was made with Hemp fiber. Hemp paper can also be recycled more times than wood-based paper.
The primary hemp fiber is attached to the core fiber by Pectin – a glue-like soluble gelatinous carbohydrate.   
Hemp (Cannabis sativa) could be an important crop enabling the production of environmentally – friendly, locally produced, high-quality textiles.</p>

<p>Hemp is a traditional fiber crop for centuries which was important in meeting our needs for textiles. It can displace the use of cotton, which requires a massive amount of chemicals harmful to people and the environment. 
It is a very strong fiber and is used in the manufacture of carpets, rugs, ropes, Garments,shoes,bags,fabrics etc., but has limited use because bleaching is difficult.</p>

<p>The bark of the hemp stalk contains bast fibers, which are among the earth’s longest natural soft fibers and also rich in cellulose.
It is easy to grow organically. That is, without a need for artificial pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers, so it can make an important contribution to a sustainable future.</p> 
<p>Hemp is grown in countries like Canada, USA, France, Hungary, Belgium, Holland, Thailand, Austria, Italy, China, Philippine island, Russia, Mexico, Germany, West Indies and India. 
Currently, the bulk of our demand for textiles is met by cotton and synthetics, both of which have serious environmental problems associated with them.</p>

<p>Followings are the steps required for Hemp processing in textiles,</p>
<ul>
<li>Retting – Harvesting is done with a conventional combine harvester machine. Once cut, the plants, which are composed of two types of fiber – long outer fibers suitable for textiles, and short inner fiber suitable for paper or industrial applications – are left in the field for about 10 to 20 days to ‘ret’.                          
Retting is of two types.
<ol>
<li>Water Retting– It involves lying the stems in water in tanks, ponds or in streams for around 10 days–it is more effective if the water is warm and bacteria-laden.
<li>Dew Retting– It is a natural process that is triggered by dew that falls on the crop each morning. After cutting, the hemp stems were laid parallel in rows to dew ret. The stems needed turning at least once (sometimes) twice in order to allow for even Retting (or rotting) being the name given to the process whereby bacteria and fungi is break down the pectins that bind the fibers to the stem allowing the fiber to be released. Retting is complete when the fiber bundles appear white, separate from the woody core and divide easily into individual finer fibers for their full length. Once this process is complete (dry), the stalks are collected and sent to the “decortication” machine.</li>
</ol>
<li> Decortication– In this process the de-leafed Hemp stems are then dried, i.e. conditioned and freed from the wood kernel in a sequence of a squeeze, break and scutching processes. In other words, it is described as breaking the stems by passing through a “breaker” or fluted rollers. Then the fiber is separated from the woody core (“scotching”) by beating the broken stems with a beech stick or passing through rotary blades.</li>

<li> Softening– By using a so-called Hemp softener or roller, the decorticated fibers are made softer and suppler.</li>

<li>Combing– The shortening of the initial fiber lengths from up to 3 m down to 650 mm is done on a special cutting machine. Then the short and tangled fibers are combed out, the long fibers are parallelized and smoothed using a hackling machine. In other words “hackling” (combing) means to remove any woody particles and to further align the fibers into a continuous “sliver” for spinning.</li>

<li> Spinning– After several drawing and doubling passages, the manufactured slivers are pre-spun roving yarns and according to quality and the desired yarn fineness, spun into Hemp yarn by wet or dry spinning processes. Although as Hemp is coarser than Flax, the pins on the board for drafting the combed fiber into a sliver needed to be set differently. The rove produced was then boiled in caustic soda to refine it and most of the yarn was bleached with hydrogen peroxide. As it is similar to Flax fibers, generally the best yarns are obtained by wet spinning. In which fibers are allowed to pass through a trough of hot water before being spun. This softens the Pectin allowing a greater drawing out and separation of the fibers and producing a finer yarn (greater than 12 Nm). Dry spinning is cheaper, producing yarns and fabrics with a different appearance and handle.
 Using the above process two types of 100% Hemp yarn is made known as long yarn and short yarn. Normally the counts are Nm 7/1, Nm 8.5/1, Nm 10/1, Nm 16/1, Nm 18/1, Nm 24/1 and Nm 36/1.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above preparatory processing of Hemp fiber incur considerable waste and add significantly to the cost of the fiber which could be made available as a raw textile fiber for 3500 USD /tons.  The Hemp was successfully processed to produce nonaligned fibers, with a yield of 20-25%.
Hemp fiber is dark tan or brown and is difficult to bleach, but it can be dyed bright and dark colors. Hemp fiber is a lustrous fiber, has characteristic nodes and joints of linen, but the central canal is wider. The cells are blunt-ended when the fiber is viewed under a microscope. The Hemp fibers vary widely in length, depending upon their ultimate use. Industrial fibers may be several inches long, while fibers used for domestic textiles are about a ¾ inch to 1 inch (1.9 to 2.54 cm) long. The elongation (1 to 6%) is low and its elasticity poor. The thermal reactions of Hemp and the effect of sunlight are the same as for Cotton. Hemp is moth resistant, but it is not impervious to mildew. Furthermore, Hemp has the best ratio of the heat capacity of all fibers giving it superior insulation properties. As a fabric, Hemp provides all the warmth and softness of other natural textiles but with a superior durability seldom found in other materials.</p>
<p>Hemp fiber is longer, stronger, more absorbent, more mildew resistant and more insulative than Cotton fiber. There are thirty varieties of Hemp fiber. It is a tall plant with a natural woody fiber. All these varieties resemble one another in general appearance and properties, but only those having fibers of high tensile strength, fineness, and high luster have commercial value. It resembles flax closely, and its fiber is easily mistaken for linen. Hemp is harsh and stiff and cannot be bleached without harm to the fiber. As Hemp is not pliable and elastic, it cannot be woven into fine fabrics. Hemp is durable and is used in rug and carpet manufacturing. It is especially suitable for ship cordage as it is not weakened or rotted by water, this means that Hemp will keep you warmer in winter and cooler in summer than Cotton. Hemp is more effective at blocking the sun‘s harmful ultraviolet rays. The nature of Hemp fibers make them more absorbent to reactive dyes, vat dyes and sulfur dyes, which coupled with Hemp’s ability to better screen out ultraviolet rays, means that Hemp material is less prone to fading than cotton fabrics are.</p>

<h3>Beauty Cultural Field
</h3>
<p>Cannabis is one of the fast growing plant with multiple benefits. It is a botanical class of cannabis with 0.3 percent or less THC content by dry weight. Cannabis is grown specifically for industrial or medicinal use, and not for drug use. It is now commonly used in products like textile, rope, shoes, food, paper, bioplastic, insulation and biofuel. The latest sector to tap in on hemp is beauty with a range of skincare and makeup products that take advantage of its medicinal properties.</p>
<p> Cannabis products are derived from the stems of the plant with high fibrous content. The beauty industry extracts its oil as the cold pressed seed oil is rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and contains all 21 known amino acids.</p>
<p>With hemp in our skin care products, we can ensure skin hydration for a long period. The omega and vitamin-rich hemp seed oil have been proven to ensure a soothing and calming effect on the skin which in turn helps reduce inflamation and treat acne, atopic dermatitis, and other skin conditiond.</p>

<h3>Architectural Field</h3>
<p>Cannabis composite building materials are "inexpensive,<b>fire-resistant construction materials</b>, with excellent thermal and sound-insulating qualities"; they are produced by "heating and compressing plant fibers to create strong construction panelling, replacing dry wall and plywood".</p>
<p>Plants absorb carbon from the atmosphere as they grow, and due to its rapid growth rate hemp is able to lock up more carbon per hectare than just about any other plant, including trees. <b>Hempcrete</b> consist of hemp 'shiv', the woody core of the hemp plant broken up into something resembling fine wood chips, which is then mixed with a lime-based binder and water. This combination sets hard to become an excellent insulator for walls, floors, or roofs. Hempcrete has numerous advantages over other building materials, including being fireproof, non-toxic, sustainable, breathable, and highly insulative.</p>
<h2>Benefits that can be gain to Sri Lanka by Hemp industry
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Many people have critisized that Cannabis industry is not good, and it must be prohibited completely from Sri Lanka. Although it has one bad effect, but there are so many good things we can gain from Hemp Industry. Experts have said that Cannabis export could overcome country's recession and pay off the depts by 2025. So, why shouldn't we take the great oppertunity to overcome the deep recession and relieve our long suffered nation with enormous economic hardship.</li>
<li>The total land area of Sri Lanka is 6,552,500 ha. Among them 77,000 ha are barren lands. If we take approximately 50,000 ha, we can get </li>
<li>By way of that we can develop the agriculture of Sri Lanka.</li>
<li>And also we can increase the self employment oppertunities for women. Because if we plant hemp women can have self employment oppertunities like planting Hemp, caring plants, spraying herbicide, and harvesting.</li>
<li>As for men we can increase job oppertunities by planting Hemp. Because after harvesting Hemp they are set to factories for furthur production works. Then men will have their jobs in factories.</li>
<li>After producing Hemp products we can export them and can get a foreign exchange to our country.</li>
<li>Also we can deploy that income to our health sector, educational sector or for our debts to other countries.</li>
<li>As a result of all these things we can decrease the poverty of the people in Thanamalwila, Monaragala, Ambilipitiya, Wellawaya, Kuda oya. Because they are some poor areas in Sri Lanka. If we could do this correctly we can make these areas like colombo.</li>
<p></p>
<h3><p><b>So we suggest not to prohibit hemp industry from Sri Lanka but to promote them to develop our country. And also don't use them for bad things!</b></p></h3>

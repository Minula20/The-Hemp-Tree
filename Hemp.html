 <h2>About Hemp Tree</h2>
<p>Cannbis sativa flowers are unisexual and the plants are often male or female.It is a short-lived flowering plant,static(male) plants usually taller and less strong than pistillate(female or male) plants.The flowers of the female plant are arranged in recemes and can procuce hundredes of seeds.Male plants shed pollen and die few weeks before female plant's seeds ripen.Under normal conditons with a light duration of 12 to 14 hours, the hereditary X and Y chromosomes produce both sexes in equal numbers.Although a plant becomes male or female by genetic factors,environmental factors, including the daily light cycle can alter sexsual expression.Naturally occuring single plant,both male or female parts infertile or fertile; but artificially induced "hermaphrodites" may have fully functional reproductive organs.The "female" seeds sold by most commercial seed suppliers are derived from synthetic "hermaphoroditic" female animals or plants treated with hormones or silver thiosulfate without the male genes.</p>
<p>Although the main psychoactive constituent of Cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant is known to contain more than 500 compounds, among them at least 113 cannabinoids; however, most of these "minor" cannabinoids are only produced in trace amounts.Besides THC, another cannabinoid produced in high concentrations by some plants is cannabidiol (CBD), which is not psychoactive but has recently been shown to block the effect of THC in the nervous system.Differences in the chemical composition of Cannabis varieties may produce different effects in humans. Synthetic THC, called dronabinol, does not contain cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), or other cannabinoids, which is one reason why its pharmacological effects may differ significantly from those of natural Cannabis preparations.</p>
<p>The main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol(THC),the plantis known to contain more than 500 compounds,including at least 113 cannabinoids;However  most of these "minor" cannabinoids are produced in small quantities.In addition to THC there is another cannabinoid cannabidiol(CBD) produced by some plants in high concentrations,which has not been psychoactive but has recently been shown to block the effects of THC in the nervous system.Changes in the chemical composition of cannabis varieties can have different effects on humans.Dronabinol,also known as synthetic THC,does not contain cannabidiol(CBD),cannabionol(CBN) or other cannabinoids, and is one of the reason why its pharamacological effects are significantly different from natural cannabis preparation. </p>
<p>In addition to cannabinoids,cannabis chemical compounds contain about 120 compounds that are resposible for its characteristic odor.These are mainly volatile tepenes and sesquiterpenses.α-Pinene,Myrcene,Linoleum,Limonine,Trans-β-ocimene,α-Turpinoline,Trans-karyophylline,Humulene,The characteristic odor of cannabis sativa contributes.Some hashish detective dogs are trained with karyphylline.Prenylthiol(3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol)which has been identified as the main odor,produce a number of volatile sulfur compounds that contribute to the cannabis plant's skull-like odor.Thses compounds are found in much lower concentrations than the major terpenes and sesquiterpenes.However,they significantly contribute to the pungent odor of cannabis due to the low odor limits often found with thiol or other sulfer- containing compounds.</p>

<p>Cannabis is one of the fast growing plant with multiple benefits. Cannabis products are derived from the stems of the plant with high fibrous content. The beauty industry extracts its oil as the cold pressed seed oil is rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and contains all 21 known amino acids.</p>
<p>With hemp in our skin care products, we can ensure skin hydration for a long period. The omega and vitamin-rich hemp seed oil have been proven to ensure a soothing and calming effect on the skin which in turn helps reduce inflamation and treat acne, atopic dermatitis, and other skin conditiond.</p> 

<h3
style="color:#800000;">Architectural Field
</h3>
<p>Cannabis composite building materials are "inexpensive,<b>fire-resistant construction materials</b>, with excellent thermal and sound-insulating qualities"; they are produced by "heating and compressing plant fibers to create strong construction panelling, replacing dry wall and plywood".</p>
<p>Plants absorb carbon from the atmosphere as they grow, and due to its rapid growth rate hemp is able to lock up more carbon per hectare than just about any other plant, including trees. <b>Hempcrete</b> consist of hemp 'shiv', the woody core of the hemp plant broken up into something resembling fine wood chips, which is then mixed with a lime-based binder and water. This combination sets hard to become an excellent insulator for walls, floors, or roofs. Hempcrete has numerous advantages over other building materials, including being fireproof, non-toxic, sustainable, breathable, and highly insulative.</p>

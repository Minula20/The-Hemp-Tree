 <h1>HEMP TREE</h1>
 <h2>About Hemp Tree</h2>
<p>Cannbis sativa flowers are unisexual and the plants are often male or female.It is a short-lived flowering plant,static(male) plants usually taller and less strong than pistillate(female or male) plants.The flowers of the female plant are arranged in recemes and can procuce hundredes of seeds.Male plants shed pollen and die few weeks before female plant's seeds ripen.Under normal conditons with a light duration of 12 to 14 hours, the hereditary X and Y chromosomes produce both sexes in equal numbers.Although a plant becomes male or female by genetic factors,environmental factors, including the daily light cycle can alter sexsual expression.Naturally occuring single plant,both male or female parts infertile or fertile; but artificially induced "hermaphrodites" may have fully functional reproductive organs.The "female" seeds sold by most commercial seed suppliers are derived from synthetic "hermaphoroditic" female animals or plants treated with hormones or silver thiosulfate without the male genes.</p>
<p>Although the main psychoactive constituent of Cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant is known to contain more than 500 compounds, among them at least 113 cannabinoids; however, most of these "minor" cannabinoids are only produced in trace amounts.Besides THC, another cannabinoid produced in high concentrations by some plants is cannabidiol (CBD), which is not psychoactive but has recently been shown to block the effect of THC in the nervous system.Differences in the chemical composition of Cannabis varieties may produce different effects in humans. Synthetic THC, called dronabinol, does not contain cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), or other cannabinoids, which is one reason why its pharmacological effects may differ significantly from those of natural Cannabis preparations.</p>
<p>The main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol(THC),the plantis known to contain more than 500 compounds,including at least 113 cannabinoids;However  most of these "minor" cannabinoids are produced in small quantities.In addition to THC there is another cannabinoid cannabidiol(CBD) produced by some plants in high concentrations,which has not been psychoactive but has recently been shown to block the effects of THC in the nervous system.Changes in the chemical composition of cannabis varieties can have different effects on humans.Dronabinol,also known as synthetic THC,does not contain cannabidiol(CBD),cannabionol(CBN) or other cannabinoids, and is one of the reason why its pharamacological effects are significantly different from natural cannabis preparation. </p>
<p>In addition to cannabinoids,cannabis chemical compounds contain about 120 compounds that are resposible for its characteristic odor.These are mainly volatile tepenes and sesquiterpenses.α-Pinene,Myrcene,Linoleum,Limonine,Trans-β-ocimene,α-Turpinoline,Trans-karyophylline,Humulene,The characteristic odor of cannabis sativa contributes.Some hashish detective dogs are trained with karyphylline.Prenylthiol(3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol)which has been identified as the main odor,produce a number of volatile sulfur compounds that contribute to the cannabis plant's skull-like odor.Thses compounds are found in much lower concentrations than the major terpenes and sesquiterpenes.However,they significantly contribute to the pungent odor of cannabis due to the low odor limits often found with thiol or other sulfer- containing compounds.</p>  
<p>A cannabis plant in its vegetative growth stage needs more than 16-18 hours of light per day to remain vegetative.Flowering ususally occurs when darkness is at least 12 hours a day.The< flowering cycle can last anywhere between seven and fifteen weeks depending on the weather and environmental conditions.Insearch of psychoactive cannabinoid production,female plants are grown seperately from male plants to form parthenocarp in the fruit of the female plant(without seeds in spanish as "sin simila") and increases the production of cannabinoid-rich gum.In the soil,the optimum pHfor the plant is 6.3 to 6.8.During hydroponic growth,the nutrient solution is best between 5.2 and 5.8,this pH range is well suited for cannabis hydropoincs as it is hostile to most bacteria and fungi.Tissue culture multiplication has become important in the production of clinically important clones,and seed production is generally the prefferred medium for multiplication.Sativa plants have narrow leaves and grow well in warm climates.However they take longer to flower than their Indica counterparts,and they grow taller than the Indica cannabis varieties.</p>

</h2>
<p>The Hemp Tree is used to make a variety of commercial and industrial products. Every part of the Hemp Tree is used to make those products. They are used in pharmecutical, textile and clothing, beauty cultural,food and flavouring, architectural field and so on.</p>

<p>Hemp seeds also contain high levels of omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids. 
Studies have shown that the ideal ratio for the fatty acids in hemp seeds is 3 to 1. At this ratio, these fatty acids help to support healthy cholesterol levels, immune system function, and helps to regulate your metabolism.</p>

<h4>Potential Health Benefits of Hemp Seeds</h4>

<p>Hemp seeds are an excellent source of plant-based protein. They contain all nine essential amino acids, and research suggests that hemp’s protein content is well-absorbed by our bodies.</p>

<p>In addition to this protein load, hemp seeds history is tied to their potential health benefits. Many modern studies have backed up several of these claims.</p>

<p>They used to eat.The flakes of the bones are seperated and eaten as a cereal.Hemp seeds are blended to make milk.The milk of hemp seed is named as "Hemp Milk".
And also the cannabis seed is used to make cofee and cookies. Hemp seeds can hold oil. Hemp oil is full of Omega 369 fatty acid. Hemp oil is also used for salads and making foods.
Alcohol can be extracted from the starch in hemp seeds. In the countries like Canada and USA, hemp spirit is used to make beer and vine(40%).
And also cannabis is used to make chocolates and fruit juice.</p>
<p>The CBD chemical in hemp is extracted and mixed with alcohol to make beverages.</p>

style="color:#800000;">Beautycultural Field
</h3>
<p>Cannabis is one of the fast growing plant with multiple benefits. Cannabis products are derived from the stems of the plant with high fibrous content. The beauty industry extracts its oil as the cold pressed seed oil is rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and contains all 21 known amino acids.</p>
<p>With hemp in our skin care products, we can ensure skin hydration for a long period. The omega and vitamin-rich hemp seed oil have been proven to ensure a soothing and calming effect on the skin which in turn helps reduce inflamation and treat acne, atopic dermatitis, and other skin conditiond.</p> 

<h3
style="color:#800000;">Architectural Field
</h3>
<p>Cannabis composite building materials are "inexpensive,<b>fire-resistant construction materials</b>, with excellent thermal and sound-insulating qualities"; they are produced by "heating and compressing plant fibers to create strong construction panelling, replacing dry wall and plywood".</p>
<p>Plants absorb carbon from the atmosphere as they grow, and due to its rapid growth rate hemp is able to lock up more carbon per hectare than just about any other plant, including trees. <b>Hempcrete</b> consist of hemp 'shiv', the woody core of the hemp plant broken up into something resembling fine wood chips, which is then mixed with a lime-based binder and water. This combination sets hard to become an excellent insulator for walls, floors, or roofs. Hempcrete has numerous advantages over other building materials, including being fireproof, non-toxic, sustainable, breathable, and highly insulative.</p>
